1. `Point2D` 

    Create a `Point2D` class in `Point2D.java` that stores the location of a point in two dimensions. It should:

    * have a 2-argument constructor that takes 2 doubles representing x and y coordinates
    * have accessor methods `getX` and `getY`
    * have mutator methods `setX` and `setY`
    * have a `distanceTo` method that takes a second "other" `Point2D` object, and returns a double representing the distance between the two points (use the distance formula)
    * have a `toString` method that formats the point in the standard mathematical way. For example, "(-2.5, 1.0)

1. `Circle`
    Create a `Circle` class in `Circle.java` that stores information about a circle in a 2D plane. It should:

    * have a 2-argument constructor that takes a `Point2D` object representing the location of the center of the circle, and a double argument representing the radius of the circle
    * have instance methods `getArea` and `getCircumference` that take no arguments, and return a double representing the area (and circumference respectively) of the circle represented
    * have a `intersects` method that takes a second `Circle` object, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the two circles share any points in common on their circumference
    * have a `contains` method that takes a second "other" `Circle`, and returns a boolean indicating whether this circle entirely contains the other circle
